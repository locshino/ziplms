## Guidelines for AI Builders

When creating new files in this directory, follow these rules:

1. **Documentation files** (`.md`, guides, reports) ‚Üí `docs/`
2. **Test files** (`.php` tests, debug scripts, utilities) ‚Üí `test/`
3. **Static assets** (`.html`, `.sql`, `.txt`, data files) ‚Üí `assets/`
4. **Root level**: Only keep `README.md` and `.gitignore`

## Git Ignore Policy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: All files in this directory are ignored by Git (except `README.md` and `.gitignore` itself). This ensures that development scripts and temporary files don't get committed to the repository.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run a specific test
php test/run_simple_test.php

# Check permissions
php test/check_permissions.php

# Debug course logic
php test/debug_admin_course_logic.php
```

## Notes

- This directory is for development purposes only
- Scripts here should not be used in production
- Always test scripts in a development environment first
- Keep the directory organized by following the structure above
